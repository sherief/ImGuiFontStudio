# [ImGuiFontStudio](https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFontStudio)

ImGuiFontStudio is a tool for Subset font and extract glyph names for use embbeded or not in a software, especially for use with ImGui for embedded way.

Greatly inspired / based on the project [IconFontCppHeaders](https://github.com/juliettef/IconFontCppHeaders)

This is my first big opensource software.

As a self learning man i always developped my softs in solo.

So maybe you will found some weird things, bad design pattern, 
bad optimization, or others bullshits :)

Please send me your feedback.
I enjoy all constructive comments and help is welcome.

Succesfully tested on my side :

* On Win 7 x64 (in exe version x86/x64)
* On Linux Debian/Ubuntu (in exe version x86)
* MacOs Mojave (in exe version x86)

## The features :

* can open ttf or otf font file
* can subset font file (one file same time or by batch)
* can generate header with corresponding glyph names and codepoint
* can generate cpp file with compressed data or for embedded use
* can merge many font file in one (the glyphs will be resized)
* can edit codepoint and glyph names
* have a project file
* many tool available for select glyphs (by zone, by line, by codepoint range)
* Cross Platform, tested on Win/Osx/Linux 
* Change / define ImGui app Theme

For more information how to use the generated files, see this project : https://github.com/aiekick/IconFontCppHeaders

My soft do the same job and more but easier for user :)

## How to Build :

You need to use cMake.
For the 3 Os (Win, Linux, MacOs), the cMake usage is exactly the same, 

1) Choose a build directory. (called here my_build_directory for instance)
2) Choose a Build Mode : "Release" / "MinSizeRel" / "RelWithDebInfo" / "Debug" (called here BuildMode for instance)
3) Run cMake in console : (the first for generate cmake build files, the second for build the binary)
```cpp
cmake my_build_directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BuildMode
cmake --build my_build_directory --config BuildMode
```

Some cMake version need Build mode define via the directive CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE or via --Config when we launch the build. 
This is why i put the boths possibilities

By the way you need before, to make sure, you have needed dependencies.

### On Windows :

You need to have the opengl library installed

### On Linux :

You need many lib : (X11, xrandr, xinerama, xcursor, mesa)

If you are on debian you can run :  

```cpp
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev
```

### On MacOs :

you need many lib : opengl and cocoa framework

## How to use generated font 

the idea is to merge the icons from your font file into the ImGui current font
you have in the generated header file, many defines 

### External Font File Use :

for instance here in this example for load embedded font, we have (with font Prefxi IGFS) :
* ICON_MIN_IGFS => min range
* ICON_MAX_IGFS => max range
* FONT_ICON_FILE_NAME_IGFS => the font file name to load (ex: fontawesome.ttf)

```cpp
 ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->AddFontDefault();
static const ImWchar icons_ranges[] = { ICON_MIN_IGFS, ICON_MAX_IGFS, 0 };
 ImFontConfig icons_config; icons_config.MergeMode = true; icons_config.PixelSnapH = true;
 ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->AddFontFromFileTTF(FONT_ICON_FILE_NAME_IGFS, 15.0f, &icons_config, icons_ranges);
```

### Embeddded Font File Use :

for instance here in this example for load embedded font, we have (with font Prefxi IGFS) :
* ICON_MIN_IGFS => min range
* ICON_MAX_IGFS => max range
* FONT_ICON_BUFFER_NAME_IGFS => the compressed buffer name you have in your_embedded_font.cpp to load 
(ex: IGFS_compressed_data_base85)

```cpp
 ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->AddFontDefault();
 static const ImWchar icons_ranges[] = { ICON_MIN_IGFS, ICON_MAX_IGFS, 0 };
 ImFontConfig icons_config; icons_config.MergeMode = true; icons_config.PixelSnapH = true;
 ImGui::GetIO().Fonts->AddFontFromMemoryCompressedBase85TTF(FONT_ICON_BUFFER_NAME_IGFS, 15.0f, &icons_config, icons_ranges);
```

### Boths cases :

In both cases, the use in code is the same :

After that step, when you have a ImGui widgett with test you just need to put int he label field,
the glyph you want, defined in the header file :
```cpp
 ImGui::Button(ICON_IGFS_FOLDER_OPEN " Open Font");
```
and you will have this reult :
